## 1. Operational Excellence
- **What was implemented:**
  - CloudWatch dashboards and alarms for ECS, ALB, CloudFront, S3
  - CodePipeline notifications via SNS
  - AWS X-Ray tracing for ECS API
  - Terraform comments, tagging, and modular structure
- **AWS Services:** CloudWatch, SNS, X-Ray, CodePipeline
- **Terraform:** `cloudwatch`, `sns`, `xray`, `operational_excellence.tf`, `CICD/codepipeline.yaml`
- **Interactions:** Dashboards and alarms support reliability and performance. Notifications improve incident response.
- **Trade-offs:** More metrics/alarms may increase CloudWatch costs.

## 2. Security
- **What was implemented:**
  - AWS WAF for CloudFront and ALB (managed rules)
  - IAM least-privilege roles for ECS, Config, etc.
  - Encryption at rest (S3, EBS) and in transit (HTTPS via CloudFront default certificate)
  - CloudTrail for auditing, AWS Config for compliance
  - Secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager
- **AWS Services:** WAF, IAM, S3, EBS, CloudTrail, Config, Secrets Manager
- **Terraform:** `waf.tf`, `security.tf`, `modules/alb`, `modules/cloudfront`, `modules/s3`
- **Interactions:** Encryption and WAF support reliability and cost (by blocking attacks). IAM and secrets management support operational excellence.
- **Trade-offs:** Enabling WAF and encryption may add latency and cost.

## 3. Reliability (Warm Standby)
- **What was implemented:**
  - ECS services and ALBs deployed across multiple AZs
  - Warm standby architecture: secondary ECS/ALB with minimal tasks
  - Route 53 failover routing and health checks
  - ECS autoscaling for both primary and standby
- **AWS Services:** ECS, ALB, Route 53, CloudWatch
- **Terraform:** `vpc`, `alb`, `ecs`, `route53_failover.tf`, `modules/vpc`, `modules/alb`, `modules/ecs`
- **Interactions:** Warm standby supports high availability and quick failover. Health checks and autoscaling support operational excellence and performance.
- **Trade-offs:** Standby resources incur some cost but provide rapid recovery.

## 4. Performance Efficiency
- **What was implemented:**
  - CloudFront caching and S3 transfer acceleration
  - S3 intelligent tiering for storage
  - ECS autoscaling based on CPU/memory
  - Athena queries for optimized log analysis
- **AWS Services:** CloudFront, S3, ECS, Athena
- **Terraform:** `cloudfront`, `s3`, `ecs`, `athena`, `performance_efficiency.tf`
- **Interactions:** Autoscaling and caching support reliability and cost optimization. Athena queries support operational excellence.
- **Trade-offs:** Some features (e.g., transfer acceleration) may increase cost.

## 5. Cost Optimization
- **What was implemented:**
  - S3 lifecycle rules for log storage
  - Fargate Spot for ECS (optional)
  - Resource tagging for cost tracking
  - Right-sizing via Terraform variables
- **AWS Services:** S3, ECS, Cost Explorer
- **Terraform:** `s3`, `ecs`, `cost_optimization.tf`, `variables.tf`
- **Interactions:** Lifecycle rules and spot instances support reliability and performance. Tagging supports operational excellence.
- **Trade-offs:** Aggressive lifecycle rules may risk data loss if not tuned.

## Justifications & Trade-offs
- **Warm Standby:** Chosen for fast failover and high availability, with minimal standby cost.
- **WAF & Encryption:** Protects against common threats and data loss, at the cost of some added complexity and expense.
- **Autoscaling:** Ensures performance and cost efficiency, but requires careful threshold tuning.
- **Lifecycle & Spot:** Reduces storage and compute costs, but must be balanced against reliability needs.
