# Final Observability Report

## 1. Architecture Overview

This E-Commerce Observability Platform leverages AWS services and Terraform for scalable, secure, and observable infrastructure. Key components include:

- **Frontend**: S3 static hosting, distributed via CloudFront
- **Backend**: ECS Fargate microservices behind ALB
- **Networking**: VPC with public/private subnets, NAT Gateway, Internet Gateway
- **Observability**: CloudWatch dashboards/alarms, X-Ray tracing, Athena log analysis, SNS notifications
- **CI/CD**: CodePipeline and CodeBuild for automated build, test, deploy

## 4. Observability & Alarms

- CloudWatch dashboards and alarms for ECS, ALB, CloudFront, S3
- SNS notifications for pipeline and operational events
- AWS X-Ray tracing for distributed microservices
- Athena queries for log analysis

## 5. CI/CD Implementation Summary

- CodePipeline orchestrates source, build, deploy, and notification stages
- CodeBuild projects for Docker, Terraform, and deployment
- SNS notifications integrated for pipeline events
- All pipeline resources and roles managed via Terraform modules

- [x] CloudWatch Dashboard screenshot
- [x] SNS alarm evidence
- [x] Terraform backend verification
- [x] Athena query results

## Implementation Notes

- All Terraform code is formatted with `terraform fmt`
- Backend state managed via S3 and DynamoDB (see scripts/bootstrap_backend.sh)
- ALB access logging and S3 lifecycle rules implemented for cost optimization
- Modular structure maintained for all resources
- See docs/ATHENA_QUERIES.md for sample Athena queries
- Run `terraform validate` and `terraform fmt` in each environment (dev, staging, prod) for best practices
